My research centers on workforce formation – the processes that determine how organizations are composed and structured. I study both demand-side dynamics (how organizations select workers) and supply-side dynamics (how workers choose jobs). This dual lens reveals that inequality is sustained not only by biased gatekeeping but also by how workers interpret and respond to existing demographic patterns.         </p>

        I created this overview diagram to help me visualize how workforces are shaped, and what they shape in return. I map my research onto this diagram, and use this diagram to position 
		other scholarship to help me find new ideas and revisit how old ones may have other ripple effects. I will continue to revisit and update this diagram.
		<br>Below I list some of my current projects, and how they map onto this diagram.

            <p>
              I introduces the concept of Hierarchical Demographic Configurations (HDCs) to explain how the racial composition of supervisors, peers, and subordinates shapes job seekers’ evaluations of organizations. 
		  Using a conjoint experiment and agent-based simulations, I show that 1) each tier has significantly different patterns of preference, and 2) even such modest preferences — when repeated across workers and time — 
		  can generate substantial segregation across organizations. The study highlights how job seekers’ attention to the demographic legacies of past exclusion helps sustain current segregation.

            <p>
              This paper develops the concept of Bias-Amplified Signals to explain how past achievements can differentially influence advancement for women and men in male-dominated settings. Drawing on longitudinal promotion data and a vignette experiment, we show that while women are initially less likely to be promoted, prior success in biased contexts yields disproportionately higher returns for them than for men. The study highlights how the value of career achievements depends jointly on candidate gender and the organizational conditions under which success is earned.

            <p>
              This paper takes a spatial perspective on organizational inequality, examining how the racial composition of surrounding neighborhoods shapes workplace demographics beyond local labor supply. Using EEO-1 and Census data with matched comparisons across proximate establishments, I find that firms in Whiter neighborhoods employ disproportionately more White workers, especially in customer-facing and low-wage roles. The effect persists even within the same firm across locations—most strongly in healthcare—highlighting how local racial norms and consumer dynamics influence organizational inequality.

		  This work highlights field-level dynamics as a key driver of structural inequality in labor markets.

          How perceived similarities between a candidate’s past and potential employers shape evaluations? My emerging findings suggest that organizational evaluators favor candidates from firms similar to their own in structure, culture, or market position. I am currently designing an audit study to test how perceived similarity and organizational prestige jointly affect callback rates for otherwise comparable candidates.
